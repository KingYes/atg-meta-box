# ATG Meta Box

A lightweight framework for easily adding meta boxes to WordPress plugins and themes.

Field types included:

- Single-line text
- Paragraph text
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Select and multiple select (uses [jQuery Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/index.html))
- WYSIWYG (uses WordPress native editor)
- File upload (uses WordPress media uploader)
- Date picker (uses jQuery UI datepicker)
- Color picker (uses WordPress Iris color picker)

More fields could be added in the future, but one of the goals of this plugin is to stay as lightweight as possible.

## Usage

ATG Meta Box can be used as a standalone WordPress plugin. The files can also be included directly in other plugins and themes.
